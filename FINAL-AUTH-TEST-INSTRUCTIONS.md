# Final Authentication Test Instructions

## Good News!
Authentication is now working correctly! I've fixed the CSRF token issues and verified that the authentication flow works properly.

## How to Test Authentication

1. Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:3457/auth/signin

2. Use one of these test credentials:
   - Email: test@example.com
     Password: password123
     
   - Email: crdjm1@gmail.com
     Password: 2ndpass

3. Click the "Sign in" button

4. You should be redirected to the dashboard at http://localhost:3457/dashboard

## What Was Fixed

1. **Changed redirect handling** in the signin page:
   - Changed from `redirect: true` to `redirect: false`
   - Added manual redirect with `router.push("/dashboard")`

2. **Updated NextAuth configuration**:
   - Added proper CSRF token cookie configuration
   - Improved redirect callback to handle all cases properly

3. **Fixed the authentication flow**:
   - NextAuth now properly handles CSRF tokens
   - Authentication redirects work correctly
   - Session management is working

## Verification from Server Logs

From the server logs, I can see authentication is working:
```
Authorize called with credentials: {
  email: 'crdjm1@gmail.com',
  password: '2ndpass',
  csrfToken: 'd29df051730459a13f284563a38d91fc0b0748524052e9ffbce0cd8d928d8f01',
  callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:3457/auth/signin'
}
User found: { ... }
Password valid: true
Authentication successful, returning user
...
Redirect callback called {
  url: 'http://localhost:3457/dashboard',
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3457'
}
Same origin URL redirect
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Clear your browser cookies for localhost:3457
2. Make sure you're using the correct credentials
3. Ensure the development server is running on port 3457
4. Try a fresh browser instance

The authentication should now work properly without CSRF token errors. Users can sign up and then immediately log in with the same credentials.
